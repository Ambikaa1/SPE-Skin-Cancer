# Personal Data, Privacy, Security and Ethics Management

## Personal Data

### Types of Personal Data

Our application will be collecting two pieces of personal data about a user:
- Their name
- Photographs of their moles

### Collecting User Consent

When the user first opens our application, we will clearly inform them that the application needs to collect their name and images of their moles in order to function. This data will be stored locally on their device, and we will not have access to this data. If they choose to accept these terms, then they will be able to use the application.

### Managing Personal Data

We will not be storing any personal data ourselves; all personal data will be stored locally on a user's device.

### Cookie Law

Our application will not be using any cookies.

### Security

The personal data collected in our application will be stored locally on a user's device. On iOS, each app runs within its own sandbox, so this data will not be visible to other applications on the device. On Android, data within a directory marked as "app-specific storage" is not accessible from other applications either. Therefore the personal data we will be storing will be secure, as it will not be accessible outside of the application itself.
