# Release Testing

#### Strategy Overview
The app is being made for the general public, therefore it is important that users of all ages and technological understanding can use the app. Throughout the development of our app we will communicate with our client, ensuring that he is happy with the setup. When we have a working app, it will be very beneficial to us to get some additional feedback from other people. To assess the experience of our app from a range of perspectives we aim to get people from a variety of age groups to try the app.

An important use of the app will be to better allow doctors and patients to identify a particular mole on the patient’s body. This can be very difficult if a patient suffers with *insert name of condition*. Our client will be able to introduce the app to some of his patients which will allow us to see how our app helps. The format in which we will receive our feedback will be the same for each person. The survey will use number lines and short answer questions which will give us easy to analyse data. From this we can spot areas of the app that need work, as well as what is working well.

#### Core User Story
The core user story we have chosen for this test table is as follows:
>“*As a member of public, I want to be faced with an easy-to-use interface so that I can easily navigate my way around the app and have the option to get help if I come across a page I do not understand how to navigate.”*

We picked this user story because it includes the ease of use requirement that is so important to our client. When developing our app, it is important that we remain aware of the range of people’s confidence when using apps and mobile phones in general. We need to create pages that contain all the required functionality in the simplest format.

#### Testing Table
Test | Explanation
-----|------------
A new user has just downloaded the app. The first time they visit each page the helper feature will be visible. | The helper feature will show small text boxes containing information about each part of the page telling the user how to navigate the page and use its features. We think it will be beneficial to have this information showing when the user opens the app for the first time, as this will enable them to begin to monitor their moles quickly and correctly. 
In the top right-hand corner of each page of the app there is a button labelled with a question mark (:grey_question:). Pressing this button once will reveal the helper information. Pressing the button again will hide the helper information. | There could be months in-between the user needing to use the app. Therefore, if the user forgets how to use any of the features, they can see the explanations given to them when they first opened the app once more. 
The pages of the app should be split up to ensure that none of the pages are overly cluttered. Each page should have a specific function. | Examples of the function of some pages would be: <ul><li>The home page: this aims to give the user snippets of key information. This includes: the link to the SCaRF charity page and the link to their donation page. It also shows the user the shortest count down (in number of days) until they need to take updated photographs for a mole.</li><li>The camera page: this function of this page is to allow the user to take a picture of their mole/lesion. It should have a button that takes a picture, a button to show and hide the ghost photograph, the back button and the helper button.</li></ul>
