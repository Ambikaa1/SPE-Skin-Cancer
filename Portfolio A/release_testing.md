# Release Testing

#### Strategy Overview
The ease of use and flow of the app has been highlighted many times by our client. It is very important that users of all ages and technological understanding are able to use the app. Throughout the development of our app we will communicate with our client, ensuring that he is happy with the setup. When we have a working app it will be very beneficial to us to get some additional feedback. This app is being made for all types of people and our choice of people to get feedback from will reflect that.

An important use of the app will also be to allow doctors and patients to be able to identify a particular mole on the body. This can be very difficult if a patient suffers with *insert name of condition*. Our client will also be able to introduce the app to some of his patients which allow us to see how are app helps. The format in which we will recieve our feedback will be the same for each person. Through the use of number lines and short answer questions we will be able to sport areas of the app that need work and also see what is working well.
