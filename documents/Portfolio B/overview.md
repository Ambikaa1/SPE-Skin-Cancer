# Overview

## Client

Our client is SCaRF (Skin Cancer Research Fund), a charity founded in 1979, with the objective of raising money for research into the causes, prevention, and treatment of skin cancer, especially melanoma, and to raise awareness of the condition.

Jon Pleat, a consultant plastic surgeon and chairman of SCaRF, is our main contact for the project. He believes that there are currently not any apps that enable patients to effectively monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer; the apps presently available on the market are expensive, difficult to use and unintuitive.

## Domain

The core domain of our project is patients wanting to monitor moles they may be worried about for changes, which could indicate skin cancer, especially melanoma.

There is an ABCDE guide to recognise the warning signs of melanoma:
- A for asymmetry; does one half of the mole not match the other half
- B for border; are the edges of the mole uneven or irregular
- C for colour; does the mole not have a uniform colour
- D for diameter; is the mole larger than normal (i.e. larger than about 6mm)
- E for evolving; is the mole changing in size, shape, colour, etc.

It is important that patients are able to monitor their moles for signs that they are evolving, and have an easy way to contact their doctor if there is anything concerning them about a mole.

The wider domain of our project is anybody who wishes to monitor their moles.

## Project

Our project is to develop an app, with a user-friendly interface, to enable users to monitor their moles and provide them with information about skin cancer.

## Vision

Our vision for the project is an app, available on both iOS and Android, that will enable users to monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer.

We believe our app should have the following features:
- A body diagram to enable users to identify where on their body a mole is located
- Serial photographs, both near and far, taken over a period of time, to enable users to monitor the appearance of their moles
- A ghost image to be displayed when taking a photograph of a mole, to help users take consistent photographs
- Notifications that users can opt-in or opt-out of, reminding them to take updated photographs of their moles
- A link to the mail app, so users can send photographs of a mole to their GP or other third parties
- Pages of information to educate users on skin cancer, containing text, photographs and videos
- Information pointers to help users navigate the app and use key features
- SCaRF charity logo should be displayed, with a link for anyone to send donations
- User-friendly interface
