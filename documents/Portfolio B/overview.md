# Overview

## Client

The client for our project is SCaRF (The Skin Cancer Research Fund), a charity founded in 1979, with the objective of raising money for research into the causes, prevention, and treatment of skin cancer, especially melanoma, and to raise awareness of the condition. 

SCaRF's objective to improve skin cancer prevention and treatment is hindered partially by the lack of tools available to their patients and the general public to monitor their moles. Jon Pleat, a consultant plastic surgeon and chairman of SCaRF, is our main contact for the project. Jon believes that there are currently not any apps that enable patients to effectively monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer; the apps presently available on the market are expensive, difficult to use and unintuitive.

## Domain

The core domain of our project is patients wanting to monitor moles they may be worried about for changes which could indicate skin cancer, especially melanoma.

There is an ABCDE guide to recognise the warning signs of melanoma:
- A for asymmetry; does one half of the mole not match the other half?
- B for border; are the edges of the mole uneven or irregular?
- C for colour; does the mole not have a uniform colour?
- D for diameter; is the mole larger than normal (i.e. larger than about 6mm)?
- E for evolving; is the mole changing in size, shape, colour, etc.?

Current NHS guidance states that one should see a GP if a mole is evolving, or there is anything else concerning them about a particular mole with regards to the ABCDE guide. Thus, it is important for patients to monitor their moles for signs they are evolving. To do so, patients may attempt to periodically assess them, and attempt to identify whether their appearance has changed. To support this, they may take photographs of their moles to capture how they look at specific points in time.

The wider domain of our project is anybody who wishes to monitor their moles.

## Project Problem

There are several problems with the current approaches used to monitor moles. In combination, these issues present an overall challenge in establishing whether or not a mole is evolving.

Many patients attempt to periodically assess their moles to identify any changes. The problem with this is that moles can change very subtlely. Therefore, it can be difficult to identify any noticeable changes. To solve this problem themselves, patients may attempt to take photographs of their moles—however, this too can be a far from optimal approach.

When taking a 'near shot' of a mole, one is more concerned in capturing the detail in the mole, as opposed to providing a solid indication as to where on the body a mole is located. This presents the second problem: it is difficult to establish, when looking back at a photograph, where on the body that particular mole is located—particularly in patients with a large number of moles as they become very difficult to distinguish.

These 'near shots' taken by patients in an attempt to make it easier to identify changes actually creates a whole new issue in itself. In order to make the comparisons effective, 'near shots' need to be consistent: the mole needs to be in the same location in the camera frame, with similar lighting, taken from an identical distance. Otherwise, the comparison photos lose effectiveness. However, there is no easy way for a patient to take consistent photographs.

An additional problem in patients with large number of moles, or patients that have been consistently photographing their moles for a prolonged period of time is that their camera roll will quickly become cluttered. This makes keeping track of their moles, finding the exact photographs they are looking for, comparing photographs, etc. a challenging task.

There is also no existing process in place to remind users to assess their moles on a regular basis.

Existing applications that seek to resolve these problems are ineffective. They either do not adequately resolve all of the problems, are too difficult to use (especially for elderly patients), or cost far too much. Our client wishes for us to develop an app, that enables users to monitor their moles without the problems outlined above, and to provide them with information about skin cancer.

## Vision

Our vision for the project is an app, available on both iOS and Android, that will enable users to monitor their moles for signs of skin cancer.

We believe our app should have the following features:
- A body diagram to enable users to identify where on their body a mole is located
- Serial photographs, taken over a period of time, to enable users to monitor the appearance of their moles
- A ghost image to be displayed when taking a photograph of a mole, to help users take consistent photographs
- Notifications that users can opt-in or opt-out of, reminding them to take updated photographs of their moles
- A link to the mail app, so users can send photographs of a mole to their GP or other third parties
- Pages of information to educate users on skin cancer, containing text, photographs and videos
- Information pointers to help users navigate the app and use key features
- SCaRF charity logo should be displayed, with a link for anyone to send donations
- User-friendly interface
