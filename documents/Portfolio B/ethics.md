# Personal Data, Privacy, Security and Ethics Management

## Personal Data

### Types of Personal Data

Our application will be collecting several pieces of personal data about a user:
- User information: fist name, family name, date of birth
- Skin cancer status: whether they've ever had skin cancer before, whether anyone in their family has had skin cancer, whether they've ever had sunburn, whether they've ever used a sunbed, whether they've ever had a job that involved working outdoors, whether they're immunosuppressed, whether they have a large number of moles on their skin surface, whether they've ever been exposed to chemicals during their occupation, whether they've ever been exposed to radiation during their occupation
- Mole photographs: far shots and near shots
- Mole information: name of the mole, comments about the mole, body part the mole is on

### Collecting User Consent

When the user first opens our application, we will clearly inform them that the application needs to collect information about them, images of their moles, and information about their moles in order to function to its full capability. This data will be stored locally on their device, and we will not have access to this data. If they choose to accept these terms, then they will be able to use the application.

### Managing Personal Data

We will not be storing any personal data ourselves; all personal data will be stored locally on a user's device.

### Cookie Law

Our application will not be using any cookies.

### Security

The personal data collected in our application will be stored locally on a user's device. On iOS, each app runs within its own sandbox, so this data will not be visible to other applications on the device. On Android, data within a directory marked as "app-specific storage" is not accessible from other applications either. Therefore the personal data we will be storing will be secure, as it will not be accessible outside of the application itself.

## Ethics Management

We are currently in the process of applying for ethics approval.
