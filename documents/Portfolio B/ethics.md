# Personal Data, Privacy, Security and Ethics Management

## Personal Data

### Types of Personal Data

Our application collects several pieces of personal data about a user:
- User information: first name, family name, date of birth
- Risk factors status: whether they've ever had skin cancer before, whether anyone in their family has had skin cancer, whether they've ever had sunburn, whether they've ever used a sunbed, whether they've ever had a job that involved working outdoors, whether they're immunosuppressed, whether they have a large number of moles on their skin surface, whether they've ever been exposed to chemicals during their occupation, whether they've ever been exposed to radiation during their occupation
- Mole photographs: far shots (one per mole) and near shots (multiple per mole)
- Mole information: name of the mole, comments about the mole, location of the mole

### Collecting User Consent

When the user downloads our application for the first time, we will clearly inform them that the application needs to collect information about them, images of their moles, and information about their moles in order to function to its full capability. They are also informed that this data will be stored locally on their device, and we as app developers will not have access to this data. By accepting these terms, they are able to use the application.

### Managing Personal Data

We will not be storing any personal data ourselves; all personal data will be stored locally on a users device.

### Cookie Law

Our application will not be using any cookies.

## Security

### Security Strategy

The personal data collected in our application will be stored locally on a users device. On iOS, each app runs within its own sandbox, so this data will not be visible to other applications on the device. On Android, data within a directory marked as "app-specific storage" is not accessible from other applications either. Therefore the personal data we will be storing will be secure, as it will not be accessible outside of the application itself.

## Ethics Management

### Ethical Concerns

Our application has minimal ethical concerns. Users consent to all data collected about them when they start the application. All data collected is stored on the users device, so is protected by the security of the operating system they are running it on (i.e. iOS or Android). The only data that can leave a users device is photographs (one far shot and multiple near shots) and information about a particular mole, if and only if a user chooses to share this information with a third party via email. To safeguard the users, we have added several warnings encouraging the user to double check the email address they are sending their information to.
